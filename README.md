# Firebase Data Retrieval Error: Type Mismatch

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using the Firebase Realtime Database. The error occurs when attempting to access data with an unexpected type, leading to unexpected behavior or crashes in the application.

## Bug Description:

The issue is related to type mismatches between the expected data type and the actual data type retrieved from the Firebase Realtime Database.  This can occur due to inconsistencies in data structure or incorrect assumptions about the data.

## Solution:

The solution involves rigorously checking the data types of data retrieved from Firebase before using them in the application logic. Input validation and type checking should be implemented to prevent such errors.
