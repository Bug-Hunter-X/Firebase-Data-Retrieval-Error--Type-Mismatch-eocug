The Firebase SDK may throw an error if the data you are trying to access is not properly formatted or if there are inconsistencies in the data structure. For instance, if you are expecting a specific type of data (e.g., a string) but the data retrieved from the database is of a different type (e.g., a number), this can cause unexpected behavior.
